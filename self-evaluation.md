# Self Evaluation
1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I tried different combinatins of array methods with mixed results. Sometimes the outcome wasn't what I was expecting based on the MDN documentation descriptions. Pop and slice weren't affecting the integers. Shift, unshift, and push seem to be most straighforward methods to apply and manipulate arrays.
2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I want to revisit the array methods when I'm fresh
3. What questions do you have about Arrays?
Which is the correct syntax?

var animal = [ "bear", "skunk", "raccoon", "horse",]
console.log (animal.indexOf("skunk"));

or 


var animal = [ "bear", "skunk", "raccoon", "horse",]
animal.indexOf("skunk");
console.log (animal);

The former works and the latter does not, so I'm guessing I should be using the console.log (variable.indexOf("elemen")); method
